# Context Strategy — Tiering & Analyze Edit-Safety

**Status: implemented.** Analyze preloads the writer's character working set in
full and edits against it; the kill test passes (a character's death lands on the
durable sheet, body preserved, across both first-analysis and re-analysis). This
**supersedes** the original "deliver bodies through `reportMentions`" plan — see
*History* at the end.

## The problem this solves

`updateFragment` replaces the whole `content` field. If analyze has only a
character's one-line **summary** in context, the model writes a short body from
what it has → the sheet is **truncated** (blind overwrite). Kill test: killing a
character replaces its full body with a one-liner.

## The relevance signal: `writerContextIds`

The piece everything else hangs on. At generation time the writer records
**`writerContextIds`** on the new prose fragment's `meta` — the fragments it
actually worked from: sticky characters + the recent cast + sticky knowledge +
anything it looked up via `getFragment`. It is deliberately **type-agnostic**
(characters *and* knowledge) and persists with the fragment, so re-analysis sees
the same set.

This is what lets context tier on *relevance* instead of inlining everything.

## Content tiering (the principle)

One rule, applied per fragment type:

| Tier | Rule |
|---|---|
| **Sticky** | full (author-pinned, always relevant) |
| **In the relevance set** (`writerContextIds`) | full |
| **Otherwise** | one-line summary (shortlist: `id: name — description`) |
| **Not in context** | fetched via `getFragment` on demand |

Characters have a *richer* relevance source than knowledge — prose mention
annotations feed the recent cast, whereas knowledge only enters the set via sticky
or explicit lookup — so in practice more characters are full than knowledge. But
both flow through the **same** signal, so the depth difference is earned by signal
density, not an unexplained lopsidedness. This is what retired the earlier
*asymmetry* blocker (below): knowledge now has a relevance signal; it didn't when
the original plan was written.

## How analyze applies it (shipped)

- Characters in `writerContextIds` render as **full sheets** (`characters-recent`);
  the rest are one-line summaries (`characters-shortlist`). The sheets are in
  context **before** any edit — no mid-loop delivery, no ordering constraint, no
  gate.
- `reportMentions` is **annotation-only** (records who appears, for prose
  highlighting); it no longer returns bodies.
- `getFragment` is the **backstop** for an appearing character not in the
  forwarded set.

### Edit safety

- `editFragment` replaces an exact span in any field (name/description/content),
  leaving the rest intact — the precise tool for a status change (e.g. "alive" →
  "deceased").
- `updateFragment` is per-field; only its `content` field is a whole-body replace.
- The blind-overwrite catastrophe is prevented **structurally**: the full sheet is
  in context before any edit, so the model edits against the real body, never the
  summary.

## Current state vs the principle (open questions, not decisions)

Two agents predate the relevance signal and still inline full bodies. Whether to
tier them is **undecided** — recorded here so the choice is explicit:

- **Analyze inlines *all* knowledge in full** every run. Good for contradiction
  detection (it checks the prose against established facts), but it scales poorly
  for lore-heavy stories. `writerContextIds` already carries knowledge, so analyze
  *could* tier it (forwarded-full + summary + `getFragment`) — trading some
  contradiction recall for tokens. Not done.
- **Directions inlines the entire cast in full** (sticky *and* shortlist bodies).
  Could tier to sticky/relevant-full + summary. Not done.
- **Writer** already tiers characters (recent cast full + shortlist summary).
  Knowledge stays sticky-full + shortlist, since knowledge has no
  recent-appearance signal of its own.

## Budget — deferred

No cap on full bodies yet. When lore-heavy knowledge or a huge-cast scene bites,
the specced fallback is to reuse the `chars/4` estimate + the `ContextCompactOption`
precedent to cap full bodies and spill the overflow to summaries + `getFragment`.
Build the knob only when a real story needs it.

## History (superseded plan)

The original design delivered character bodies by having `reportMentions`
**return** the mentioned sheets mid-loop, with a `prepareStep` gate forcing
`reportMentions` to run before any edit tool, and kept the mechanic
**analyze-only** on the grounds that "knowledge has no relevance signal, so giving
the writer character bodies would be asymmetric." That shipped briefly, then was
replaced once `writerContextIds` gave both types a shared relevance signal: bodies
are now **preloaded** from the forwarded set rather than returned by a tool, and
the gate and the sheet-returning `reportMentions` are gone.

## Cleanups noted

- `recentMentions` (librarian state) is push-only and never trimmed → it grows
  forever and its keys drift toward "every character ever." Trim to a recent
  window, or drop it in favor of the per-fragment `meta.annotations`.
